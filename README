    	 		LazyCat 

LazyCat is a tool which allows you serve cluster of Linux hosts in
comfortable way. The main idea is that you can install, upgrade or
remove software on all hosts at the same time, and get general view of
what is going on with your cluster.

Its server uses GNU Guile extension language upon C code, which allows
to call C functions from Scheme code and vice versa. It means that you
can write your own GUI for server or extension without knowledge of C
language.

LazyCat is distributed under the terms of GNU GPLv3 license or (at
your option) any later version. See COPYING for details.

     ARCHITECTURE

The top part of the LazyCat server is written in Scheme, which is a
dialect of the Lisp language. Why Scheme? Because it is good for
hacking and making new features upon the core of a program. LazyCat
was written to be extensible, to fit to user's needs.
     
The bottom part of the server is written in C, and offers API
functions which can be called from Scheme code. This part contains DB
which stores basic information about hosts. Other job that the server
does on this level is sending messages through proxies.

Proxies are processes which are used by the server to sending messages
through computer network. A proxy is just a function which is executed
in different process.

A host process is a deamon. You have to have one on every host which
you want to control by LazyCat.

Here is the nice ASCII-art which shows you LazyCat architecture:

+--------------------------------------------+
| GUI (Scheme)                               |
+---------------------API--------------------+
| Server (C)                                 |

+-------------------+    +-------------------+

     USAGE

After building it from lazy sources (see INSTALL for details about
this process), you can run LazyCat from command line - just type
follows:

     $ ./lazycat

and you'll get the Guile shell. That's it. You can do something useful
right now, by using LazyCat API directly. For example, you can add new
hosts to the cluster from the Guile shell:

     guile> (lc-add-host "tcp-proxy" "127.0.0.1:50001" "localhost" "My Lazy Server")
     1
     
you can get list of hosts:

     guile> (lc-get-host-list)
     '(1 2 3)
     
and, of course, you can do something useful with this:

     guile> (lc-send-msg 1 "uname")
     [2012-06-19 21:06]
     Linux

But wait, where is the promised perfect GUI with beautiful buttons,
menus etc? OK, take a look in scheme/ directory in the root dir of
LazyCat repository. Here is your Lazy-GTK-Cat which you can run this
way:

     ./lazycat -s scheme/lazy-gtk-cat.scm

And from this point things going more interesting.

     HACKING

Here I'm going to figure out a few ways as you can have fun with
LazyCat (except using it for your tasks).
    
Because LazyCat use Guile and Scheme to do all top-level logic and
to draw GUI, you can easy replace these components with your own
components builded upon the basic API of the LazyCat server.

Probably the most exciting news are that you can test your own GUI
by just typing

     ./lazycat -s your-own-lazy-gui.scm

Happy hacking!
