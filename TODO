* Add signal handling
  Implement signal handling for processes.

* Periodical ping
  lazycat-daemon should check periodically if the hosts are accessible
  and store statues.  There already is a basic implementation of the
  ping in proxies.

  Of course, UI should show host statuses to the user.

* Use Glade for lazy-gtk-cat
  Replace hand-written interface in the code with Glade XML-based
  interface description.

* Proxy configuration.
  There is a potential issue with configuration of proxies.  It seems
  that the better way is that we should be able to pass parameters for
  a proxy by using LazyCat API.

* XMPP proxy.
  It'll be interesting to have a proxy that will allow us to
  communicate with hosts through the XMPP (Jabber) protocol.

* Add authentication mechanisms for TCP proxy and host process.
  This is a low-priority task, because ssh-proxy seems more suitable
  for real tasks than tcp-proxy.
