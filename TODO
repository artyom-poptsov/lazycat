* Add signal handling
  Implement signal handling for processes.

* Fix a problem with ssh-proxy
  The proxy crashes if the periodical ping is enabled.  It seems that
  it depends on the traffic activity -- the more active traffic goes
  through the proxy, the sooner it crashes.

  Problem can be reproduced by enabling the periodical ping and
  setting ping-interval to small value (i.e. 5 seconds or less).

* Show host statuses in lazy-gtk-cat

* Use Glade for lazy-gtk-cat
  Replace hand-written interface in the code with Glade XML-based
  interface description.

* Proxy configuration.
  There is a potential issue with configuration of proxies.  It seems
  that the better way is that we should be able to pass parameters for
  a proxy by using LazyCat API.

* XMPP proxy.
  It'll be interesting to have a proxy that will allow us to
  communicate with hosts through the XMPP (Jabber) protocol.

* Add authentication mechanisms for TCP proxy and host process.
  This is a low-priority task, because ssh-proxy seems more suitable
  for real tasks than tcp-proxy.
