* Asynchronous API.

* Proxy configuration.
  There is a potential issue with configuration of proxies.  It seems
  that the better way is that we should be able to pass parameters for
  a proxy by using LazyCat API.

* XMPP proxy.
  It'll be interesting to have a proxy that will allow us to
  communicate with hosts through the XMPP (Jabber) protocol.

* Make use wchar for messages.

* Add authentification mechanisms for TCP proxy and host process.
  This is a low-priority task, because ssh-proxy seems more suitable
  for real tasks than tcp-proxy.
